# LinearRegression
Linear Regression is a statistical supervised learning technique to predict the quantitative variable by forming a linear relationship with one or more independent features.It calculates the value of a dependent variable from an independent variable and measures the association between these variables. Linear regression method is the most widely used in statistical and machine learning techniques.This project uses machine learning system for stock market prediction and and a motor trend data which explores the relationship between a set of variables and miles per gallon(mpg). In this project, it summarizes the method in which different types of Linear Regression models were build using MATLAB on the above mentioned datasets.
## Introduction
The aim of this project is to build linear regression model for different scenarios like:\
* One-dimensional problem without intercept
* One-dimensional problem with intercept
* Multi-dimensional problem \
For the first experiment Turkish stock exchange data is used in which the data organized with regard to working days in Istanbul Stock Exchange.For the next two experiments MT cars data issued which describes the model using a set of variables like displacement, weight, power and miles per gallon(mpg). One dimensional linear regression problem is simple linear regression which helps to find the linear relationship between two continuous variables, one independent and one dependent feature.

# LinearRegression
Linear Regression is a statistical supervised learning technique to predict the quantitative variable by forming a linear relationship with one or more independent features.It calculates the value of a dependent variable from an independent variable and measures the association between these variables. Linear regression method is the most widely used in statistical and machine learning techniques.This project uses machine learning system for stock market prediction and and a motor trend data which explores the relationship between a set of variables and miles per gallon(mpg). In this project, it summarizes the method in which different types of Linear Regression models were build using MATLAB on the above mentioned datasets.
